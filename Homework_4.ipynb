    "<b>Due date</b>: 11pm, Wednesday May 2nd\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission method</b>: see LMS\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Submission materials</b>: completed copy of this iPython notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Late submissions</b>: -20% per day\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Marks</b>: 5% of mark for class\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Overview</b>: In this homework, you'll be creating an 'artificial intelligence' player for the classic Hangman word guessing game. You will need to implement several different automatic strategies based on character level language models, ranging from unigram approaches to higher over n-gram models. Your objective is to create an automatic player which makes the fewest mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Materials</b>: See the main class LMS page for information on the basic setup required for this class, including an iPython notebook viewer and the python packages NLTK, Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, and Gensim. In particular, if you are not using a lab computer which already has it installed, we recommend installing all the data for NLTK, since you will need various parts of it to complete this assignment. You can also use any Python built-in packages, but do not use any other 3rd party packages; if your iPython notebook doesn't run on the marker's machine, you will lose marks.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Evaluation</b>: Your iPython notebook should run end-to-end without any errors in a reasonable amount of time, and you must follow all instructions provided below, including specific implementation requirements and instructions for what needs to be printed (please avoid printing output we don't ask for). You should leave the output from running your code in the iPython notebook you submit, to assist with marking. The amount each section is worth is given in parenthesis after the instructions. You will be marked not only on the correctness of your methods, but also the quality and efficency of your code: in particular, you should be careful to use Python built-in functions and operators when appropriate and pick descriptive variable names that adhere to <a href=\"https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/\">Python style requirements</a>. If you think it might be unclear what you are doing, you should comment your code to help the marker make sense of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Extra credit</b>: Each homework has a task which is optional with respect to getting full marks on the assignment, but that can be used to offset any points lost on this or any other homework assignment (but not the final project or the exam). We recommend you skip over this step on your first pass, and come back if you have time: the amount of effort required to receive full marks (1 point) on an extra credit question will be substantially more than earning the same amount of credit on other parts of the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Updates</b>: Any major changes to the assignment will be announced via LMS. Minor changes and clarifications will be announced in the forum on LMS, we recommend you check the forum regularly.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Academic Misconduct</b>: For most people, collaboration will form a natural part of the undertaking of this homework, and we encourge you to discuss it in general terms with other students. However, this ultimately is still an individual task, and so reuse of code or other instances of clear influence will be considered cheating. We will be checking submissions for originality and will invoke the Universityâ€™s <a href=\"http://academichonesty.unimelb.edu.au/policy.html\">Academic Misconduct policy</a> where inappropriate levels of collusion or plagiarism are deemed to have taken place.\n"

    "**Instructions:** To get the extra credit, you should try to develop a more effective AI for hangman. Feel free to engage your creativity here! Possibilities include better conditioning on the length of the word and the parts that are known, fancier smoothing methods, using backwards ngram models, or a fancier inference algorithm like forward-back using a HMM. Ensure you report the test performanceÂ of your method.\n",
